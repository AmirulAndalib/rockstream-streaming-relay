<h3 align="center">Info For "Bin Folder"</h3>

PHP, FFMPEG, NGINX Binaries already included if you downloaded from [Release Page](https://github.com/sandyh90/rockstream-streaming-relay/releases)
so you don't have to download again that binaries

## What Happpend With This Folder?
Due github limit the upload for all git repository and GitHub blocks pushes that exceed 100MB
and that why i moved that included binaries only in release page
